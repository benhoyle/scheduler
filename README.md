# Skeleton

A skeleton set of files to help accelerate development on Python pet projects.

Clone this project then rename references to "skeleton". 
E.g. change this to the name of your project (e.g. "FunApp").

The ```core.py``` file holds the main classes and functions. 

Generic helper functions are found in (and are added to) ```helper.py```.

Database models for SQLAlchemy are found in ```models.py```.

The ```webserver.py``` file holds a basic Flask webserver for the frontend.

To start the webserver that implements the user interface run:
```python -m skeleton.webserver```
and point your browser to:
```localhost:3000```

Remember to edit the data in ```setup.py```.

Once started you can install by cd-ing to the project directory and running:
```pip install .```

Library for [doing stuff].
